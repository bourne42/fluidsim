This project was developed exclusively on Windows using Visual Studio 2010.
The project should compile on other systems if the proper libraries are linked.
You'll need SFML which has builds for OS X and Linux and the GL extension for
TEXTURE_3D functions.

To view the 3D velocity field rendering, you'll need to uncomment and comment
the right lines in the FluidSim3D::draw function.

To view the 2D simulation, comment out the #define FLUID3D in main.cpp

In 3D, the simulation can be rotated with WASD and the velocity field can be
zoomed in on with the mouse wheel.
